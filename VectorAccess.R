#vector arithmetics, r is vectorized programming language
#no need for loops just add vector a to vector b
#you can also perfrom boolean operation between vectors
#Recycling of Vector- When one vector is smaller, R will 
#recycle it to use again with the other bigger one
#vector is the basic building block of R, even a
#single number is Vector
#Vectors canbu used in fuctions and functions can 
#produce array
